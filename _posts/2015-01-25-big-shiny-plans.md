### We've got Books

Of course.

### A Courtyard Beside the Place

The only location on Main Street to relax and enjoy the day outside.

### A Food Cart in the Courtyard

Hotdogs and tacos are the mainstay of food carts, and we'll have those, but you'll also find fresh soups, juices and bowls full of local mixes.

### Seating for 30

50 when we open the second floor.

### A Second-Run Movie Theater

Any movie by request.  Cheap tickets.  Bring your own refreshments.

### A Low-Power AM Radio Station for the City

FCC rule Part 15 allows AM broadcasting at 100mW without a license, and since modern transmitters and antennas reach 2-3 mile -- and even farther to car stereos -- we can run a radio station for the city at low cost.  The station will air original shows, including local news, weather, talk and call-in shows, and sell local business ads and play plenty of public domain shows like old-time radio and classic recordings.  We'll broadcast live shows from LG Brewskis and high school sports.  We'll house the studio and transmitter in my storefront and install an antenna on the roof.  All the transmission and studio hardware will cost about $1,500.  Fees for music and other licensed content, plus a single phone line bring operational costs to about $1000 per year.
