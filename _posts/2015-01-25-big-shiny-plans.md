### We've got Books

Of course we've got books.  I owned a couple thousand books before turning my addiction into a profession.  Now I own a few thousand more, and they adorn the walls of my bookstore.  We've got good coffee available on a donation basis too, as well as baked goods from the [Union Bagel Shop](http://unionbagelshop.com/).

### A Food Cart in the Courtyard

Hotdogs and tacos are the mainstay of food carts, and we'll have those, but you'll also find fresh soups, juices and bowls full of local mixes.

### A Courtyard

Relax and enjoy the day on Main Street.  You know, tables under umbrellas.  Eat lunch, or at night drink a scotch and smoke a cigar.

### Seating for 30

Seating for 50 when we open the second floor.

### A Second-Run Movie Theater

Any movie by request, on the big screen.  Cheap tickets.  Bring your own refreshments.

### A Low-Power AM Radio Station for the City

FCC rule Part 15 allows AM broadcasting at 100mW without a license, and since modern transmitters and antennas reach 2-3 mile -- and even farther to car stereos -- we can run a radio station for the city at low cost.  The station will air original shows, including local news, weather, talk and call-in shows, and sell local business ads and play plenty of public domain shows like old-time radio and classic recordings.  We'll broadcast live shows from LG Brewskis and high school sports.  We'll house the studio and transmitter in the storefront and install an antenna on the roof.  All the transmission and studio hardware will cost about $1,500.  Fees for music and other licensed content, plus basic utiltiies, brings operational costs to about $750 per year.

### A Marijuana Retailer

Under Measure 91, [recreational marijuana](http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Pages/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx) becomes legal under Oregon law starting July 1, 2015.  By January 4, 2016, the OCC must begin accepting licenses for commercial growing, processing, wholesale and retail operations statewide.  Further details are a complete mystery at this point, and trustworthy insiders hint that members of the OLCC are pretty baked right now.  We intend to sell from our basement, reachable through a hatch on the sidewalk.
