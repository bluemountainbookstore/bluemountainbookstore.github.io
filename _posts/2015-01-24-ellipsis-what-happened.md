### Too Clever

Ellipsis is a cool name, but more suited to a club in the city than a bookstore in a small town.  Sure did like that logo, though.

### Too Obscure

I got tired of spelling and explaining the name Ellipsis.  Some might say a little obscurity is good for memory retention, but in my experience people forgot the name almost immediately after hearing it.  No good.

### Too Vague

Ellipsis Bookstore never sounded right, so I just called it Ellipsis, leaving it open.  This begged the question, "So, what is Ellipsis, anyway?" which is a hard question to answer for Main Street traffic driving by.
