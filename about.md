### The Names

The city of Union, named after the north side of the Civil War, is situated inside Eastern Oregon's Grande Ronde Valley, the largest enclosed valley in the US.  The Blue Mountains form the western edge of this great circle, and according to reliable sources they're called the Blue Mountains on account of their color.  They look blue sometimes.

I almost called the bookstore [Ellipsis](/articles/ellipsis-what-happened/).

### The Building

The bookstore's located in an old brick building.  Aaron Sommer built it in 1870, and went on to build a bunch of other brick buildings in La Grande and Summerville.  The Levy Brothers General Store ran here for several decades, serving as a supply point on the Oregon Trail, and later for the gold mines and lumber operations that once thrived in the region.  It was a Baptist church in the 70s into the 80s.  Sometimes it served as a theater for film and live performance.

### The Books

All kinds of books on all kinds of subjects, from rare collectibles to trashy pulp fiction.  We'll gradually list select inventory online here in the form of a [rare book catalogue](https://www.ilab.org/eng/catalogs/index.html).

### The Site

This website rocks [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/bluemountainbookstore/bluemountainbookstore.github.io) with a tweaked [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme.  It's geeky, but it's elegant, powerful and free.
