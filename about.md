### The Name

The city of Union is situated inside Eastern Oregon's Grande Ronde Valley, the largest enclosed valley in the US.  The Blue Mountains form the western edge of this great circle, and according to reliable sources they're called the Blue Mountains on account of their color.  They look blue sometimes.

### The Building

The bookstore's located in an old brick building.  Aaron Sommer built it in 1870, and went on to build a bunch of other brick buildings in La Grande and Summerville.  The Levy Brothers General Store ran here for several decades, serving as a supply point on the Oregon Trail, and later for the gold mines and lumber operations that once thrived in the region.  It was a Baptist church in the 70s into the 80s.  Sometimes it served as a theater for film and live performance.

### The Books

All kinds of books on all kinds of subjects, from rare collectibles to trashy pulp fiction.  We'll gradually list select inventory online here in the form of a [rare book catalogue](https://www.ilab.org/eng/catalogs/index.html).

### A Pseudoseussian Guide to Book Condition Terms

**New** means new.

**As New** is new to you, and if I never told you, you'd swear it was new too.

**Fine** shows its age but no damage, and like a fine wine it may increase in value more than average.

**Near Fine** is strong but shows one minor flaw, like a superhero with a weakness, a great fighter with a glass jaw.

**Very Good** is nice, but some jerk obviously read it once or twice.

**Good** ain't so great after all, meaning one flaw that's big or a few that're small.

**Reading Copy** barely qualifies as a book anymore, so read it quick and chuck it out the door -- just don't bring it back to the bookstore.

**Fire Starter** isn't even good for reading, and it's hardly worth rhyming about.  Nevertheless, these books can serve a crucial role in your outdoor survival strategy.  Keep them dry -- or dry them out if you fished them out of a river or something -- and they'll keep you warm in an emergency situation.  They say books can change your life, but these books could save your life.  The covers may be bowed, ripped, chipped, cocked, bumped or altogether dumped.  Dust mites but no dust jacket.  Rampant foxing, highlighting, underlining, creasing throughout.  Waterstained, dampstained, Rorschachstained no doubt.  Crushed tails and dog-eared heads.  The text block may resemble an old Yellow Pages formerly strapped to a public telephone in the rain and currently carted around by a homeless guy who will reluctantly use it for toilet paper.  These books can also be used for target practice.

### The Site

This website rocks [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/bluemountainbookstore/bluemountainbookstore.github.io) with a tweaked [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme.  It's geeky, but it's elegant, powerful and free.
